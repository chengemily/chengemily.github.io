## Beige Book
I scrape and analyze the text from the Federal Reserve's Beige Book from 1970--2020.  The project can be found on [GitHub][bb-github].  Preliminary results indicate that the sentiment in the reports tracks GDP growth well.

Using the differential impact of the introduction of Medicare Part D as an instrument, I show that the opioid epidemic has negative impacts on local labor markets.  The latest version of the paper can be found [here][op-pdf].
